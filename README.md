# Food Recommendation System

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<p>If you start to cook regularly, you will be realized that choosing a menu is hard as much as cooking. To avoid this pain, I came up with the simple food recommendation system based on data collected from users.</p>  
<br>
<p>Here are some notes about how it works.
You have to choose 4 favorite dishes. Based on your choice, the code will find the other user who has the most similar food preference.</p> 
<p>- Then, it will recommend new/favorite dishes chosen by a user who has a similar preference with yours.</p>
<p>- I assume that I already have 20 users' favorite food data('datapools'). By clicking the start button, the 'datapools' will be randomly created. When you choose 4 favorite dishes, the code will also push your '4 favorited dishes' data into the datapool.</p>

<p>Bon appetite!</p>
